# -Forest-Fire_Prediction_Using_FWI
This project predicts forest fires using the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system. Key parameters include Temperature, RH, Wind Speed, Rain, FFMC, DMC, ISI, and fire Classes. The dataset represents two regions: 1 for the first and 2 for the second. This model aids in identifying high-risk areas for effective forest fire management.
